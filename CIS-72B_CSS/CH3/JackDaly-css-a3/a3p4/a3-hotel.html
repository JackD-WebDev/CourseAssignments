               place to visit. So go ahead and immerse yourself in our themed environment and enjoy your stay. Then
               repeat as necessary. </p>

            <h3><span class="headingtext">Our Images</span></h3>
            <p>The main hotel image came from a Google Image search for "clocktower."
               The interior shot of the clocktower came from searching for images of the clocktower
               (in this case, The Emerson Bromo-Selzer Tower)
               chosen in the intial search, and come's from the clocktower's website.
               The gears came from a clip-art search for "gears" and were edited further in Inkscape.
               Finally, the main background image came from a Google Image search for "Steampunk Gears" and was found on
               Pixabay.com.
